# SkillPath: The Elite Career Architect 🚀

![SkillPath Banner](https://github.com/shauryap9006/Skillpath/raw/main/public/banner.png) <!-- Note: This is a placeholder, adjust path if needed -->

SkillPath is a high-performance AI platform designed to eliminate the guesswork from career progression in tech. By leveraging deep-learning and data-driven analysis, it bridges the gap between a developer's current skill set and their target role.

## ⚠️ The Problem Statement
In the modern tech landscape, engineers face a critical **"Information Asymmetry"** problem:
- **The Vocabulary Gap**: Disconnect between developer language and ATS/Recruiter terminology.
- **The "Noise" Problem**: Generic courses that contain 80% fluff.
- **Cultural Calibration**: Ignoring the difference between Startups, Mid-size, and Enterprise roles.

## ✅ The SkillPath Solution
SkillPath provides a **precision-engineered roadmap** for career transitions. It doesn't just list skills; it calculates the "Delta" (the difference) between your current state and a specific job requirement.

### Core Features:
- 🎯 **Gap Delta Analysis**: Deep-learning comparison engine ranking technical deficiencies by market demand.
- 📚 **The 80/20 Syllabus**: Focus on the high-impact competencies that actually get you hired.
- ⚡ **MVC Profiling (Minimum Viable Competencies)**: Identify the exact 4-5 skills needed for interview readiness.
- 📅 **Time-to-Ready Countdown**: Predicts your "Ready Date" based on pace and skill complexity.
- 🏢 **Company-Type Calibration**: Tailor your trajectory for Startups, Scale-ups, or Big Tech.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy: "Cinematic Engineering"
SkillPath is built to feel like a premium tool for elite talent. Every interaction—from the "limelight" navigation spotlight to the staggered history list—is designed to provide satisfying, tactile feedback. 

- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle blurs, border-glows, and deep-space color palettes.
- **Typography**: `Instrument Serif` (Bold Display) & `Geist Mono` (Technical Precision).

## 🧠 Backend Architecture: "The Deterministic Delta"
SkillPath uses a **Hybrid Analysis Pipeline** to ensure instant core analysis with creative synthesis:

1. **MVC Data Model**: Curated dataset of 70+ role categories with weighted skills.
2. **Deterministic Pipeline**: Local extraction and scoring via `pdf-parse` and regex-based synthesis.
3. **AI Synthesis**: Strategic use of Llama 3 for contextual resource generation and semantic reasoning.
